      <h1>Bridging Language Gaps in Federal Nepal</h1>

      <p>Established in 2018, <strong>Language and Media Support Services (LAMSS)</strong> was founded with a powerful vision — to bridge the growing gap between service seekers and professional translators and interpreters in Nepal.</p>

      <h2>Why Language Services Matter More Than Ever</h2>

      <p>With Nepal adopting a federal system of governance, provinces are increasingly recognizing multiple languages for official use. This has created a rising demand for accurate, culturally sensitive, and professional language services.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the entry of inexperienced intermediaries in the market has caused:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Increased service costs for clients</li>
        <li>Compromised translation and interpretation quality</li>
        <li>Unfair compensation for real language professionals</li>
        <li>Lack of accountability and ethical standards</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The LAMSS Approach</h2>

      <p>Founded by three experienced translators and interpreters, LAMSS directly connects clients with verified professionals. The organization ensures:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Minimum 5 years of professional experience for every expert</li>
        <li>At least a Bachelor’s Degree qualification</li>
        <li>Proven track record with national and international institutions</li>
        <li>Transparent and fair pricing mechanisms</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, LAMSS guarantees quality service while maintaining reasonable pricing for service seekers.</p>

      <h2>Building the Future of Language Professionals</h2>

      <p>LAMSS is not just a service provider. It is a capacity-building institution aiming to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Train young professionals in translation and interpretation</li>
        <li>Promote language services as a respected full-time career</li>
        <li>Develop and enforce a national code of conduct</li>
        <li>Unite translators and interpreters under one professional umbrella</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Through experience sharing in consecutive and simultaneous interpretation, document translation, and multilingual communication, LAMSS continues to contribute to Nepal’s evolving governance and development landscape.</p>

      <p><strong>At LAMSS, language is more than communication — it is connection, credibility, and trust.</strong></p>

      <h1>Quality First: The LAMSS Professional Standard</h1>

      <p>Quality lies at the core of LAMSS’ mission, vision, and operational philosophy. In translation and interpretation, even the smallest error can create major misunderstandings. That is why LAMSS has established a rigorous quality assurance system.</p>

      <h2>Strict Professional Requirements</h2>

      <p>To maintain high standards, every translator and interpreter working with LAMSS must meet the following criteria:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Minimum of 5 years of hands-on experience</li>
        <li>Bachelor’s Degree or higher qualification</li>
        <li>Experience working with at least 5 I/NGOs</li>
        <li>Proven translation of at least 500 pages for development agencies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Background checks are conducted to verify professional integrity and reputation.</p>

      <h2>International Assignment Standards</h2>

      <p>LAMSS does not deploy interpreters for international assignments without prior international exposure. This ensures confidence, professionalism, and cultural adaptability in global settings.</p>

      <h2>Comprehensive Language Services</h2>

      <p>LAMSS offers a wide range of services including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Translation & Editing</strong> (Nepali, English, Hindi)</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation</strong> (Simultaneous & Consecutive)</li>
        <li><strong>Transcription & Subtitling</strong></li>
        <li>Note-taking & Rapporteuring</li>
        <li>Content & Report Writing</li>
        <li>Press Releases & Event Support</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Transparent Pricing Model</h2>

      <p>LAMSS follows a fair pricing system based on <strong>350 words per source document page</strong>. This protects clients from being unfairly charged based on physical page count and ensures transparency in billing.</p>

      <p>Having worked with institutions such as UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, OXFAM, GIZ, Swiss Embassy, and the World Bank, LAMSS continues to maintain its reputation for reliability and excellence.</p>

      <p><strong>When accuracy, professionalism, and trust matter — LAMSS delivers.</strong></p>
